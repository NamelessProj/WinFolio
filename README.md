# WinFolio
This is my Portfolio. My goal was to have a lot of fun doing it... I did.

For the home page, I've made a copy of Windows 11.

To access everything that's on the main screen, you need to double-click.

If you look at the bottom of your screen, you'll find a taskbar. On it, you can find the start menu that you can toggle.

In the start menu, I let you discover what makes what. Some buttons will take you to some of my account.

I won't tell you everything there is, you'll need to experiment by yourself to know what is doing what.

Because my main page is Windows, for my other pages, I've chosen to make game or program that I personally like.
